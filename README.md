# SomnolentTweeters

This program tweets a randomly chosen sentence from

http://www.somnolentworks.com

on the account found at

https://twitter.com/SomnolentWorks

## Install
This was written for python 3.3.  It also requires the twitter python package

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter/

which can be installed via pip

```bash
pip install twitter
```

## How to Use it
You can't!  At least not in it's current form.  In order to tweet to the
@SomnolentWorks twitter account, you need a private key that I have, in order to
ensure not just anybody has write-access to the account.  However, this code can
be modified to be used for similar services for different twitter apps.  In
order to run the script, use

```bash
python somnolent.py <consumer_secret_key>
```
